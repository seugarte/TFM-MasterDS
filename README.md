## Data obtention
To obtain our dataset, we had to use a process called 'web scraping' with which we could access to all information of each car of the catalog.
To run this method, we created a python notebook: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/blob/master/scrapers/Scraping_process.ipynb

## Data processing
Parsering of the data into int types and cleaning of outliers: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/blob/master/data_processing/Data_processing.ipynb
