## Introduction
All the liers of the world.
## Data obtention
To obtain our dataset, we had to use a process called 'web scraping' with which we could access to all information of each car of the catalog.
To run this method, we had to create a python file called 'coches_scraping.py', which is available in this url: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/blob/master/scrapers/coches_scraping.py
## Data processing
Parsering of the data into int types and cleaning of outliers.
