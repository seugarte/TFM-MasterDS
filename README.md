# Final Project of Data Science - Kschool
## Sergio Ugarte Salvador

### Introduction
This project consist on a second-hand cars recommender system.
It must be run on a Linux distribution...

### Motivation
I decided to develop this project because there are a lot of people who have several problems when they want to buy a second-hand car with guarantees...

### Technologies
The technologies that I had to use to develop this recommender system are:
- Python
- Flask
...

### Data obtention
To obtain our dataset, we had to use a process called 'web scraping' with which we could access to all information of each car of the catalog...
To run this method, we created a python notebook: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/blob/master/web_scraping/Scraping_process.ipynb

### Data processing
Parsering of the data into int types, changing many values and cleaning of duplicates....: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/blob/master/data_processing/Data_processing.ipynb

### Visualization of the results
When we finished the previous procedures, we had to create a Flask application to visualizate the results...
Concretely, we created the next application: https://github.com/seugarte/TFM-MasterDS/tree/master/web
